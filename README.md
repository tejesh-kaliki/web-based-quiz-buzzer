# Web Based Quiz Buzzer

Developed a web-based buzzer for an event organised at my college. This consists of an admin-side as well as user-side. User can register themselves with a team name, and the admin is resposible for managing the users, activating/deactivating the buzzer, and viewing the list of participants that activated the buzzer in chronological order. This web app was made using Flutter, and hosted at Firebase.

The web app is deployed at the following URL:
User-side: https://tech-kshetra.web.app/#/buzzer
Admin-side: https://tech-kshetra.web.app/#/buzzer-admin
